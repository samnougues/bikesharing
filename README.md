This a graph that shows the most used bukes.  In this graph, we can see that the usage is pretty spread around.
## Summary: 
-This data shows that most people who use Citi bikes are men, who are subscribers, and who are traveling to lower Manhattan.  The usage by mostly men may be because riding a bike in NYC is fairly dangerous because of the traffic density.  Lower Manhattan is a popular destination because it has alot of businesses.
-One future visualization would look at information of the start location for women. Also, they can look at stop locations for women. Maybe this information can lead to more women using the City bikes.
